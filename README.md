working of the program 

you migth have leanred in the school that seconds/60 is equal to mins then well 189 secs is 3.15 mins which does not mean 3 mins and 15 secs 

so in a case you have time of some videos in x mins and y secs then you can simply enter the x.y or mins.secs in the exe file of all the videos and enter 0.99 for quiting the entry , after this the program will execute algorithms , seperate teh secs from the mins and then add them all and show you result in number of minutes and secs
